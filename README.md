<h1 align="center">Artificial Intelligence</h1>

This project was given as a final exam for "Artificial Intelligence" at Singidunum University. The goal of this course was to teach students about how AI works and how to prepare data for AI training.

The project required that each student selects a dataset from one of the given sources, do exploratory data analysis, prepare the data for AI, and then train a model on the data. The model should be able to predict the target variable.
